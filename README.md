# BlogPedia
Blogpedia is a web application created with React.js and Firebase. It features registration and login functionality using Firebase Auth, and for the database, we utilize Firestore. Users can easily create profiles and compose blogs by providing details such as title, thumbnail, description, etc. Once submitted, the blog is stored in Firestore, and users receive a convenient acknowledgment pop-up. Furthermore, users have the flexibility to modify or delete their own blogs. The pop-ups, generated using react-toastify, enhance the user experience. The application also incorporates routing through react-router-dom for seamless navigation. Robust validations are in place to authenticate users, ensuring the security and authenticity of every interaction within the platform.
